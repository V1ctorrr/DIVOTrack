## Abstract
Cross-view multi-object tracking aims to link objects between frames and camera views with substantial overlaps. Although cross-view multi-object tracking has received increased attention in recent years, existing datasets still have several issues, including 1) missing real-world scenarios, 2) lacking diverse scenes, 3) owning a limited number of tracks, 4) comprising only static cameras, and 5) lacking standard benchmarks, which hinder the investigation and comparison of cross-view tracking methods. To solve the aforementioned issues, we introduce **DIVOTrack**: a new cross-view multi-object tracking dataset for **DIV**erse **O**pen scenes with dense tracking pedestrians in realistic and non-experimental environments. Our DIVOTrack has ten distinct scenarios and 550 cross-view tracks, surpassing all cross-view multi-object tracking datasets currently available. Furthermore, we provide a novel baseline cross-view tracking method with a unified joint detection and cross-view tracking framework named CrossMOT, which learns object detection, single-view association, and cross-view matching with an all-in-one embedding model. Finally, we present a summary of current methodologies and a set of standard benchmarks with our DIVOTrack to provide a fair comparison and conduct a comprehensive analysis of current approaches and our proposed CrossMOT.

## Dataset Description
We collect data in 10 different real-world scenarios, named: `'Circle', 'Shop', 'Moving', 'Park', 'Ground', 'Gate1', 'Floor', 'Side', 'Square', 'Gate2'`. All
the sequences are captured by using 3 moving cameras: `'View1', 'View2', 'View3'` and are manually synchronized. 

In the old version, the corresponding scenarios named: `'circleRegion', 'innerShop', 'movingView', 'park', 'playground', 'shopFrontGate', 'shopSecondFloor', 'shopSideGate', 'shopSideSquare', 'southGate'`. The corresponding camera named: `'Drone', 'View1', 'View2'`.
